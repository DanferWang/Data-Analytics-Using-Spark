# Data Analytics Using Spark
This repository stores some projects about data analytics which are all programmed by Scala using Spark

## Music Recommendation
    This project is aimmed at simple and brief recommended system on music. 
    The rating metric is the playcount of every user on every artist whose songs have been played before.
    I use collaborative filter and ALS to establish model. The detail algorithm has been uploaded to this proiect directory alongwith one paper which provides the theory basis.
    Datasets are open-scourced, from Audioscrobbler, which have main three text file and one ReadMe.txt.
    What needs to caution is the datasets this GitHub project is NOT complete due to the limitation of file size, below 25MB. Please take care!
    The full datasets you can download by reading DATASET_README where there is an URL and extract code.

    Also, I have one DLog for you to learn and follow, however, it is in Chinese!
